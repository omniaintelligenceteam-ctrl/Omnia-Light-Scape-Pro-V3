# Omnia Light Scape Pro — Improvements Roadmap

Prioritized list of changes to improve activation, UX, and code health.

---

## 🔥 Priority 1: Fix Activation (Users sign up but don't generate)

### 1.1 Add Demo Mode / Sample Photo
**Problem:** Users sign up but don't have a photo ready to test.
**Solution:** Add a "Try with sample photo" button on the Editor screen. Include 2-3 sample house photos they can generate on instantly.
**Files:** `components/ImageUpload.tsx`, `App.tsx`

### 1.2 Onboarding Flow
**Problem:** After signup, users land somewhere but don't know the next step.
**Solution:** First-time users get a 3-step guide:
1. "Upload a daytime photo of a property"
2. "Select your fixtures"
3. "Generate your mockup"
**Files:** `components/onboarding/`

### 1.3 Empty State CTAs
**Problem:** Empty screens don't guide users toward action.
**Solution:** Each empty state should have a clear CTA pointing to the Editor.
- Projects empty → "Create your first mockup"
- Schedule empty → "You'll see jobs here once quotes are approved"
**Files:** `components/EmptyState.tsx`

## 🎯 Priority 2: Quick UX Wins

### 2.1 Fix Price Display Bug
**Problem:** Saw "$2,977.083" — three decimal places on currency.
**Solution:** Ensure all price formatting uses `.toFixed(2)` or a currency formatter.
**Files:** Search for price/amount rendering across components

### 2.2 Project Card — Hide $0 on Drafts
**Problem:** Draft projects show "$0" which looks broken.
**Solution:** Show "—" or hide price entirely until quote is generated.
**Files:** `components/pipeline/`

### 2.3 Name Redundancy on Cards
**Problem:** Cards show "Lee / Lee" when client name equals project name.
**Solution:** If client name === project name, show once. Otherwise show "Client — Project".
**Files:** Project card components

### 2.4 Calendar Event Visibility
**Problem:** Small dot indicator for scheduled days is easy to miss.
**Solution:** Make dot slightly larger, or add count badge when multiple events.
**Files:** `components/ScheduleView.tsx`

---

## 🏗️ Priority 3: Code Health

### 3.1 Break Up App.tsx
**Problem:** `App.tsx` is 607KB (~15,000+ lines). This is a maintenance nightmare.
**Solution:** Extract into logical modules:
- `routes/` — route definitions
- `providers/` — context providers
- `layouts/` — layout components
- Keep App.tsx as thin orchestration layer
**Impact:** Faster IDE, easier debugging, cleaner git diffs

### 3.2 Break Up SettingsView.tsx
**Problem:** 90KB single component.
**Solution:** Each settings section should be its own component in `components/settings/`.

### 3.3 Break Up QuoteView.tsx
**Problem:** 83KB single component.
**Solution:** Extract line items, totals, client info, etc. into subcomponents.

## 📈 Priority 4: Growth Features (Post-Launch)

### 4.1 Before/After Install Photos
Let techs upload actual install photos. Builds portfolio, proves work quality.

### 4.2 Automated Review Requests
After job marked complete, auto-email client asking for Google review.

### 4.3 Maintenance Contracts
Recurring annual/seasonal service packages. Predictable revenue.

### 4.4 Online Invoice Payments
Clients click link → pay via Stripe. Reduces collections friction.

### 4.5 Demo/Share Link for Mockups
Contractors send clients a link to view the AI mockup. "See what your home could look like."
